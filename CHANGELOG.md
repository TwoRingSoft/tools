## [rebuild-sims 1.0.1] 2018-09-17

### Added

#### `rebuild-sims`
	- Previously named each simulator as `device_type_name (runtime_name)`, but that broke with convention what other tools like `simctl` or Fastlane rely upon as defaults. Now just name them by the device name.

## [rebuild-sims 1.0.0] 2018-09-17

### Added

- `rebuild-sims` to delete and rebuild all possible simulators
